## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Ale&Ele Bake is a baking blog where I'll share my own self-developed recipes, baking tips, and baking basics for inexperienced bakers to become able to make professional looking cakes, pastries, artisan breads, tarts, French macarons, meringues and candies from scratch. 

I’ll share  my love for recipe development through a weekly post that will contain either a recipe, tips, or basic-skills instruction for non-experienced bakers.
 
I am a self-taught baker and recipe creator who has developed a passion for crafting sweets for the past seven years.
I currently live in Florida, but I’m Mexican (born and raised), and pride on adding a touch of Mexican and Latin American flavors to my creations. I sell my baked goods at www.aleandelebake.com, my online pastry catering site where residents of the Tampa/ St. Petersburg Bay Area can pre-order and purchase pastries, custom cakes, cookies, and full dessert table services. I’ve now decided that I also want to share my baking journey through a bilingual blog where I can inspire other inexperienced bakers to discover and test their culinary talents just as I did mine. The blog will also be linked to my website for blog visitors to be able to place orders and pay for baked goods.
